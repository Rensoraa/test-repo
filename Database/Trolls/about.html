    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      This website provides a community-driven database of Steam profiles, focusing on player behavior and in-game offerings.
      The goal is to help players identify trends and patterns within the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      All data is fetched through the Steam API using a Cloudflare Worker proxy - ensuring both speed and privacy.
      Users can submit Steam IDs along with a reason; every submission is reviewed before being displayed.

    <h2>A Word from the Creator</h2>
    <p>
      This project was created by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rensora/">Rensora</a> out of frustration with players who disrupt farming sessions and ruin the experience for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to reach out on Steam if you have questions, feedback, or suggestions.
      Thank you for contributing and helping keep this community resource accurate and fair!
